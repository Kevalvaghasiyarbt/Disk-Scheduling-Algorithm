# Disk Scheduling Algorithm                                                     	
It is the project of OS (disk scheduling algorithm) on the website. It consists of all the disk scheduling algorithms with input-output of seek time and real-time graph. In this, we will build a website for visualization of the Operating System Disk Scheduling Algo.

step 1: Go to http://localhost/project/home.php
step 2: If you already have login id and password you can directly login and if you are a new user so you can create your new id and password
step 3: You can directly move from login page to the home page,you can click on the button Know more to see the description of the project.
step 4: In the topic page all the algorithms are listed and you can click on it according to your preference to run it.
step 5:Database is attached to the file so you can also access it.
Step 6:Admin page username:admin password:admin
Step 7:Admin can see the list of all the users
